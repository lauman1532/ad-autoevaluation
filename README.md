# Automated Evaluation of Atopic Dermatitis by Image Processing and Machine Learning
ad-autoevaluation is my UROP and final year project. The aims of this project included: (1) preprocessing of clinical skin images of atopic dermatitis (AD) patients, (2) to evaluate the severity of erythema sign of AD by utilising supervised learning.

Due to privacy reasons, skin image dataset cannot be provided.
