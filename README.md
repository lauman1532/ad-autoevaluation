# ad-autoevaluation
ad-autoevaluation is my UROP and final year project. It is to preprocess clinical skin images of atopic dermatitis (AD) patients
and to auto-evaluate the severity of AD by utilising supervised learning.

Due to privacy reasons, skin image dataset cannot be provided.

## Dependencies
The scripts require:
* Python (>= 3.5)
* NumPy (>= 1.11.0)
* SciPy (>= 0.17.0)
* scikit-learn (= 0.20.3 if you want to use the trained models)
* joblib (>= 0.11)
